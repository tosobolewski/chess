tkinter chess game (work in progress)

TODO:
- new rules to pawn capture - pawn may capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, 
  by moving to that square
- check
- mate
- pawn promotion
- pawn en passant move - When a pawn advances two squares from its starting position 
  and there is an opponent's pawn on an adjacent file next to its destination square, 
  then the opponent's pawn can capture it en passant (in passing), and move to the square the pawn passed over. 
  This can only be done on the very next move
- add game over scenario attached to 'End Game' button
